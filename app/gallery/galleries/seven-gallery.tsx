            Yousef wrote a <a href="/dawas-writing" className="bold underline">writing</a> piece after the war on Gaza in 2021 where his
            family farmland was destroyed. He recounts the destruction of his
            family&apos;s orchard by an Israeli missile strike in May 2022. The
            orchard trees produced olives, oranges, clementines, loquat, guavas,
            lemons and pomegranates, and its loss as he described destroyed an
            important piece of his family&apos;s past, history, and heritage.
