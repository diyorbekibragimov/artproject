            The writer, Hiba Abu Nada, recited this poem in an interview in
            April 2023 (available on youtube). Hiba states that this poem is
            about the loneliness of a Palestinian as they are battling and
            facing a violent settler colony all alone. There is repetition of
            the word “our loneliness”. The loneliness is born of the grief of
            loss, loss of life that even poetry cannot bring back: “no poetry
            could ever bring it back: what the lonely one has lost”. The
            loneliness is also born of, as she has stated in the interview, the
            loneliness of being alone in fighting your own annihilation against
            the genocidal enemy, Israel: “our loneliness, one where none will
            stand up for us”. In the interview, she states that a writer is one
            who writes to voice the ideas and thoughts of the people. She
            believes that writers are the voice of a society. The interviewer
            states that because of writers voicing out what the general public
            thinks, there is a consensus in ideas and so people do not feel so
            alone in their thoughts anymore. She agreed to that thought, which
            was perhaps also her aim in this poem: to acknowledge the loneliness
            that an entire people share, so that they could feel less alone in
            that feeling.
